Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution. Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.  Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.  Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time
